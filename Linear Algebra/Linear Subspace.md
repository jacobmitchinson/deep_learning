A linear subspace is defined as a set of vectors that satisfies the following:

1. It must have a zero vector e.g. [0, 0]
2. The vectors must be closed to multiplication 
3. The vectors must be closed to addition

What does closed mean? Closure means that when we multiply a vector by a scalar that the resulting vector must be in that set.

In practice this means that only linear combinations can be subspaces.
