A unit vector is a vector of length 1. Unit vectors help us find the direction of a vector even when not considering the magnitude. Unit vectors are typically denoted using i, j and k. To calculate the unit vector of a vector we first need to get the vector's magnitude. To find the magnitude, we can do the following. The components of our vector are as follows:

```math
$$
\begin{pmatrix}
1 \\ 2
\end{pmatrix}
$$
```

To calculate the unit vector of a vector we first must calculate its magnitude:

```math
$$
\sqrt{1^2+ 2^2}=\sqrt{5}
$$
The magnitude is then â‰ˆ2.23607. To now find the unit vector we need to do the following:
$$
\begin{pmatrix}
1 \\ 2
\end{pmatrix}
\div2.23607 
$$
```

This gives us the unit vector of:

```math
$$
\begin{pmatrix}
0.447 \\ 0.894
\end{pmatrix}
$$
```
